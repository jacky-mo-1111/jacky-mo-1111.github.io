Excited to share that our new paper, [RedCoder: Automated Multiâ€‘Turn Red Teaming for Code LLMs](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.22063) is now available on arXiv! It introduces RedCoder, an autonomous agent that systematically generates multi-turn adversarial interactions to expose vulnerabilities in code-generating LLMs.
