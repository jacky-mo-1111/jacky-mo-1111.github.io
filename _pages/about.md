<!-- I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Davis. I love [LUKA](https://luka-group.github.io/). And I love my advisor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/)

My research focus is NLP. more specifically, AI safety. Build robust safe LLM or LLM4Code. Backdoor attack, defense, detection, jailbreak attack and defense.  -->

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) in [LUKA](https://luka-group.github.io/) lab.

My research primarily focuses on AI safety, particularly in building secure and reliable LLMs and LLM4Code. I explore various aspects of ensuring the safety and robustness of these models, including defending against and detecting backdoor attacks. In addition, my work extends to understanding and mitigating jailbreak attacks, where models are manipulated to generate harmful or unintended outputs.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
